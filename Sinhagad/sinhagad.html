        Sinhagad Fort, Pune Overview
        
    </h3><hr>

    
    <p>

        Located in the Sahyadri Mountains, Sinhagad Fort is an ancient fortress known for its historical significance and architecture. 
        It was once known as Kondhana and has witnessed a number of battles; one notable battle being the 1670 Battle of Sinhagad. 
        The name, “Sinhagad”, literally means Lion’s Fort signifying its strength and brilliance. 
        Today, the structure is a perfect landmark for trekkers as it is located at a height of over 750 metres in the Sahyadri Mountains. 
        In fact, the fort is strategically built right in the centre of the line of Maratha forts built in the Sahyadris. 
        Some of these citadels are the Rajgad Fort, Torna Fort and the Purandar Fort. 
        The place is also famous among photographers and nature lovers.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Sinhagad Fort and its surroundings mostly provide a good environment for a quick getaway. People living nearby often head to the attraction over the weekend. 
        Back in the time, renowned personalities like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi have also visited the fort for meetings and holidays. 
        The mountain also serves as a great location for training of the National Defence Academy Students. They hike up the hill till the fort in complete battle gear. 
        Due to its historical and cultural significance, there are restrictions on partying, cooking/ consuming non-vegetarian food, alcohol etc. Nonetheless, 
        one is bound to have a great time if they avoid these activities and soak in the dilapidated yet striking structure and the scenic surroundings.

    <h3 style="color: darkorange;text-align: center;">History</h3>
    <p>
        Sinhagad Fort is believed to be a 2000-year-old structure which was initially known as Kondhana (named after sage Kaundinya). 
        The presence of the Kaundinyeshwar Temple and some carvings on the caves denote this possibility. Till the early 14th century, 
        the fort was ruled by Nag Naik who was a Koli King. But, in 1328, it was captured by Muhammad bin Tughlaq. Later on, when Pune 
        was handed over to Shahaji Bhosale managed the fort. Shahaji served as a commander for Ibrahim Adil Shah I during the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shivaji, Shahaji's son, initiated Swarajya around the same time and refused to serve Adil Shah. 
        In an attempt to gain control of Kondhana, in 1647, he convinced an Adilshahi Sardar, Siddi Amber, 
        that he would manage and safeguard the fort optimally. But instead, he took over the fort. Adil Shah imprisoned Siddi Amber 
        and Shivaji’s father, Shahaji Bhosale. He later traded Shahaji’s release in return of the fort in 1649. However, Shivaji captured 
        it again in 1656 with the help of Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande, his General.
    </p>
    <p>    The Mughals also attacked the fort between 1662 and 1665 in order to acquire it. 
        In 1665, the Treaty of Purandar was signed between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and 
        Jai Singh I and the fort were handed over to Jai Singh. But, once again, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 
        conquered it immediately after and managed it till 1689. After Sambhaji Bhosale’s passing, the Mughals took over. 
        However, in 1693,  the Marathas won it again and in 1703, it was conquered by Aurangzeb. 1706 onwards, till 1818, 
        it was again under the Marathas and then taken over by the British.</p>
